## What is Thread Starvation?

**Scenario:** Low-priority threads waiting for a long time because high-priority threads are continuously executing.
```commandline
class Starvation extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " executing");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Starvation t1 = new Starvation();
        Starvation t2 = new Starvation();
        t1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
        t2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}

```
**ðŸŽ¯ Solution:**

1. Use Fair Locking with ReentrantLock.
2. Use Thread.yield().

## What is Thread Pool? Why do we need it?

**Scenario:** If you have 1000 tasks to execute, creating 1000 threads will consume memory.
```commandline
package itsp;

import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor;

public class ThreadPool {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService es = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
        for(int i = 0 ; i <= 10 ; i++){
            es.submit(()->{
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+"is Executing");
            });
        }
        es.shutdown();
    }
}
```
**OUT PUT**
```pool-1-thread-1is Executing

## What is the difference between wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()?

 |method | Description|
 |------|----------------|
  | wait | Pause the thread|
|notify | weakup the one thread|
|notifyAll | weakup all Thread|

**for notify notifyAl and Wait you can use the notifyExample package**

## What is Thread Interruption? How to Stop a Running Thread Gracefully?
**Imagine you are processing 1 lakh records in the background, and the user wants to cancel the process in the middle.**
```commandline
package itsp;

public class StopThreadGradefull implements Runnable{
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for(int i= 0 ; i<=100 ; i++){

            if(Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()){
                System.out.println("Thread Interrupted ... Stopping Tasking ");
                break;
            }

            System.out.println("processing the Thread "+i);
            try{
                Thread.sleep(100);
            }catch (InterruptedException id){break;}
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
       Thread th =new Thread(new StopThreadGradefull());
        th.start();
        try{
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        }catch (InterruptedException ie){}
        th.interrupt();
    }
}

```
**Explanation:**
1. Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() â†’ Checks if the thread is interrupted.
2. interrupt() sends a signal to stop the thread.
3. It will break the loop immediately.
4. If the thread is sleeping, it will throw InterruptedException.

##  What is Thread Livelock? How to Solve It?

```package itsp;

public class LiveLock {

    static class Worker{
        private boolean active = true;
        public synchronized void work(Worker other)throws InterruptedException{
            while(active){
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" working");
            }
            Thread.sleep(100);
            other.giveChance(this);
        }

        public synchronized void giveChance(Worker other){
            active =false;
            other.active=true;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Worker wk = new Worker();
        Worker wk1 = new Worker();

        new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                wk.work(wk);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }, "Thread -1 ").start();
        new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                wk1.work(wk1);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }, "Thread -2").start();

    }


}
```

**ðŸ”‘ Output:**
1. The program will never end â€” Livelock
2. Both threads are continuously giving chance to each other without finishing their task.

## How to Use ThreadLocal in Java?
**Scenario:**
Imagine you have multiple threads, and each thread needs its own copy of data like User ID or Session ID.
```class ThreadLocalExample {
    static ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocal = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 100);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + threadLocal.get());
            threadLocal.set(threadLocal.get() + 10);
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " (After Update): " + threadLocal.get());
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

##   How to Implement Callable + Future for Multi-threading?
**Scenario:))
Imagine fetching user data from the database and doing Email Verification at the same time.

---
## Scenario:
Imagine you are developing a banking system where multiple users are trying to withdraw money from a shared bank account at the same time. You need to ensure that no two users withdraw money simultaneously in a way that could lead to an incorrect balance (i.e., preventing race conditions).

**Question:**
How would you implement a thread-safe bank withdrawal system using Java multi-threading? Write a Java program that ensures thread safety while allowing multiple users to withdraw money concurrently.

**Answer:**
To solve this problem, we use synchronized methods or ReentrantLock to prevent race conditions. Below is the Java implementation using synchronization:
```commandline
package itsp;

public class BankAccount {

    int blance;
    public BankAccount(int blance){
        this.blance=blance;
    }
    public synchronized void withdraw(String user,int amout){
            if(blance >= amout){
                System.out.println(user+" Trying to Withdraw Rs.  "+amout);
                try{
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                }catch (InterruptedException ie){}
                blance = blance - amout;
                System.out.println("Transetion Success Amount is "+amout);
            }else{
                System.out.println("insuficent Balance");
            }
        System.out.println("Reamining Balance "+blance);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount ba = new BankAccount(3000);
//        BankUser bankUser1 = new BankUser(ba,"vivek",1000);
//        BankUser bankUser2 = new BankUser(ba,"Ram",1000);
//        BankUser bankUser3 = new BankUser(ba,"Raja",1000);
//        Thread th1 = new Thread(bankUser1);
//        Thread th2 = new Thread(bankUser2);
//        Thread th3 = new Thread(bankUser3);
            Thread th1 = new Thread(new BankUser(ba,"vivek",1000));
            Thread th2 = new Thread(new BankUser(ba,"Ram",1000));
            Thread th3 = new Thread(new BankUser(ba,"Raja",300));

        th1.start();
        th2.start();
        th3.start();


    }
}

class BankUser implements  Runnable{

    private BankAccount bankAccount;
    private String user;
    private int amount;

    public BankUser(BankAccount bankAccount,String user, int amount){
        this.bankAccount=bankAccount;
        this.user=user;
        this.amount=amount;
    }
    @Override
    public void run() {
        bankAccount.withdraw(user,amount);
    }
}

```
## Alternative Approach using ReentrantLock:
Instead of using synchronized, we can use ReentrantLock for more flexibility:
```package itsp;

import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
public class BankAccountReentrantLockThread {
    int balance;
   private ReentrantLock reentrantLock = new ReentrantLock();
   // private ReentrantLock reentrantLock = new ReentrantLock(true);
    BankAccountReentrantLockThread(int balance){
    this.balance =balance;
    }
    public void withdraw(String user, int amount) {
        reentrantLock.lock();
      // boolean accordLock = reentrantLock.tryLock();
        //if(accordLock){}else{do somethid pallel}
        try {
            if (balance >= amount) {
                System.out.println(user + " Trying to withdraw amount " + amount);

                Thread.sleep(1000);
                balance -= amount;
                System.out.println(user + " successfully withdrew " + amount);
            }else{
                System.out.println("your amount is "+amount+" \nyour  Balance is"+balance);
           }
            System.out.println("Remaning Balance " + balance);
         }catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }finally {
            reentrantLock.unlock();
        }


    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccountReentrantLockThread ba = new BankAccountReentrantLockThread(2000);
        Thread th1 = new Thread(new BankUser1(ba,"rani",20));
        Thread th2 = new Thread(new BankUser1(ba,"raja",30));
        Thread th3 = new Thread(new BankUser1(ba,"raja",30));
        th1.start();
       th2.start();
       th3.start();
    }
}
class BankUser1 implements  Runnable{
    private BankAccountReentrantLockThread bankAccountReentrantLockThread;
    private String user;
    private int amount;

    public BankUser1(BankAccountReentrantLockThread bankAccountReentrantLockThread , String user, int amount){
        this.bankAccountReentrantLockThread=bankAccountReentrantLockThread;
        this.user= user;
        this.amount= amount;
    }
    @Override
    public void run() {
        bankAccountReentrantLockThread.withdraw(user,amount);
    }
}
```
**Fairness**

Synchronized blocks donâ€™t offer any mechanism of a waiting queue and after the exit of one thread, any thread can take the lock. This could lead to starvation for a thread which is waiting for a very long period of time. To avoid this a Lock should be fair.

Synchronized keyword doesnâ€™t support fairness. Any thread can acquire lock once released and there is no mechanism to provide the preference. On the other hand, we can make a ReentrantLock fair. Fairness property provides lock to longest waiting thread. While creating an instance of ReentrantLock, we can define the fairness property.
